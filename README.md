# My website
Personal website for Jasmine Ball.
Please navigate to https://www.jasmineball.net .

# Overview
Written in React, HTML and CSS, this version of my website is based on the popular 'create-react-app'.
I'm also building up a basic NodeJS back-end to retrieve blog articles from a MariaDB database.

# Files
The three main files are App.js, index.js, and Styling.css.
NodeJS files will reside in the NodeJS folder.
